"""The block-scale fp8 grouped GEMMs' dispatcher: the dense block-scale class's ranking heuristic at the grouped launch's shape,
and the placement rule of the intermediate's requantization.

As for the bf16 classes (:mod:`.schedule`): a grouped GEMM is the dense class under a different scheduler, so its records are
ranked by the dense dispatcher's model at the dense shape whose tiles, M tail and operand bytes are the grouped launch's
(``M`` = the rows of one active expert, ``N`` = the active experts' weight rows side by side), for the block-scale format
(``in_fmt="e4m3_bs"``: the fp8 instruction rate, the promotion hand-off chain, no 2-CTA issue gain for the lockstep pair),
with the dense dispatcher's decode guard and its few-token N-cluster rule, mapped onto the grouped space and filtered by the
grouped body's acceptance. The requantization's two spellings (GEMM1's epilogue on the whole-block tiles, or the standalone
pass on the bf16 intermediate) are placements of one term: ``fused_quant_default`` picks by the rows per active expert.
Numerics-neutral: every record of the space computes the class.
