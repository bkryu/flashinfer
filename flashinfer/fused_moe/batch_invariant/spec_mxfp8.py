"""Canonical dataflow of the MXFP8 x MXFP8 MoE FFN classes ``moe.mxfp8.<act>``.

The class quantizes the activations and the expert weights with the ``mxfp8.quant`` class
(:mod:`flashinfer.batch_invariant.quantization.mx_spec`: e4m3 values, one UE8M0 scale per 32-element block) and runs the
two GEMMs as grouped placements of the dense MXFP8 class of the part (:mod:`flashinfer.gemm.batch_invariant.spec` at
``in_fmt = "mxfp8"`` on SM100 / SM103, ``"mxfp8_k64"`` on SM107: the block scales are operands of the block-scaled
step). Because the scales live inside the step, the class has no software scale: GEMM1's epilogue is the bf16 classes'
chain on the dequantised fp32 accumulators (every typed activation of the layer, :func:`.spec.glu_elem` /
:func:`.spec.act_elem`), the intermediate is quantized by the same quantizer class on the materialised bf16 row (its
declared second pass), GEMM2's epilogue is the plain ``cvt_bf16`` of the accumulator, and the routing and the
slot-order combine are the bf16 classes' (:mod:`.spec`). Everything numeric is therefore already specified once; this
module names the composition and its identifier.

The instruction class is a dimension of the specification: the SM107 step folds 64 elements where the SM100 / SM103 step
folds 32 (`gemm.mxfp8.kfold64` vs `gemm.mxfp8.kfold`), so the fingerprint carries the class of each GEMM by name, as
``fingerprint("mm_mxfp8", ...)`` does for the dense class.
